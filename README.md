# Prediction-card-fraud
This project aims to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms.

It analyzes transaction data and classifies them as fraudulent or legitimate based on various features, enabling the identification of suspicious transactions in real-time.
# Project Description
Credit card fraud is a major concern in the financial industry, and this project aims to address this issue using machine learning. 

By training a predictive model on a dataset of historical transactions, the goal is to accurately classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent. 

The project uses different machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate the best model for fraud detection.
# Technologies Used

Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Jupyter Notebooks 

Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset (Kaggle)
# STEPS
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, scale features, and perform encoding if needed.

Model Training: Train different models and perform cross-validation.

Evaluation: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score

# Results
After testing multiple models, we observe that Logistic Regression Model achieved an accuracy of 94%.

The evaluation metrics are displayed in the results section of the notebook.

Visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves are included to demonstrate the modelâ€™s performance.
